# Tic_Tac_Toe_Game
This is my first completed game

OBJECTIVE:

This project was to develop a Tic Tac Toe game using Java. It is a computer program that plays Tic Tac Toe against another player.

To know what and how to play the Tic Tac Toe game, please see the description below.

GAME DESCRIPTION:

Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game (both being human players).

In this game, there is a board with 3 x 3 squares.

Each of the two players take turns putting marks (an 'X' or an 'O') on the 3x3 board.

The goal of a Tic Tac Toe game is to be one of the players to get three of the same symbol in a row - horizontally, vertically or diagonally on a 3 x 3 grid.

The player who first gets 3 of their symbols (an 'X' or an 'O') in a row - vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game.

The game can be played by two players. There are two options for players: (a) Human (b) Computer (This is not yet avaiable, but will be available in a future update).

GAME RULES:

Player 1 starts the game, with Player 1 starting as the 'X' counter & Player 2 will start as the 'O' counter.

Player 1 and 2 take turns making moves with Player 1 playing an “X” counter and Player 2 playing an “O” counter.

A player marks any of the 3x3 squares with their mark (an 'X' or an 'O') and their goal is to create a straight line horizontally, vertically or diagonally.

There are only two possible outcomes to the game:

1. If either player becomes the first to create a straight line horizontally, vertically or diagonally, then that player wins the game.

2. If no one can create a straight line with their own counter and all the positions on the board are occupied, then the game ends in a draw.
